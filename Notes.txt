We start with 3 nodes, the nodes will have scores of:
    interaction, similar_words

Likes should have the source of the like, but for simplicity, that
is not added. Comparing scores simply is an interaction to interaction
distance, the closer to zero, the closer the match when comparing

Popularity of a video is used by finding the average interaction score and
everything above that score is considered popular.

Every round:
A video is created
    Calculate interactions average on the network
A video is added. (after initial 3 nodes created)
    The new video is created with only "similar words" score and interactions 0.
    And existing node will be picked to point to the new node via similar words.
    Two other edges will be formed so the new video is recommending existing videos.
    This will be by similar words "only" for one, and similar words combined with
    the highest interaction threshold with the other.
One edge will "move"
    A random edge will be removed
    A list of nodes with no edges will be prepared and the most favored video by
    interaction will be selected as a target, the node with the most similar words
    will be the source
Score update
    increase interaction score based on the "in-degree".  Need "in-degree" examples
    for a better idea
